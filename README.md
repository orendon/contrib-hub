# About
[ContribHub](http://contribhub.com) was born on 2012 at PulsoConf/BogotaConf hackathon after 14 hours of sleep-deprived programming, with the goal of creating a good tool to help other open source lovers to find projects to contribute.

There is still a lot of work to do, but these are the core features:
* Submit your repo as "Help Wanted"
* Search repos by your personal interests and useful filters
* Find projects needing help or people "near you" doing cool stuff
* Contribute, collaborate.
